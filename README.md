# Writeup collector for GZ::CTF

> **Warning**
> 
> This project won't work with the original codebase, as it requires two customized APIs. For more information, please refer to [idawnlight/GZCTF@5eeef8a](https://github.com/idawnlight/GZCTF/commit/5eeef8a7ba7ddf2f35f5f03a708ecb1f56b59963).
> 
> You may want to add authentication when implementing the two APIs.

> **Note**
> 
> You may want to disable php execution in the `writeups` directory. Remember to do that if you mounted the directory with docker.
